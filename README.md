# Disease_Detection

This is a initial version of this project.
<br>
As of now one can detect whether the given MRI scan is benign(not cancerous brain tumor) or it is malignant(cancerous brain tumor) using this given model. 
<br>
I will keep on adding different machine learning model for different type of medical scans like X-ray scans.
<br>
End goal is to add a classification model for as many medical scans possible and then deploy it where an user can simply select the type of medical scan and upload his/her scan image and get the initial results with some confidence level.
